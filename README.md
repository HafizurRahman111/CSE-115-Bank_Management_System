# CSE-115_Bank_Management_System

Bank Management System Project Using C Programming Language
This simple system was developed for a c programming language project, the first Computer Science and Engineering project of my undergraduate life. This will help the banking system create a new account, see and manage transactions, verify the details of an existing account, store the info of the customers, etc.
